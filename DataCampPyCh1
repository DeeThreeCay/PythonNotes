#Common Misconception of Data Types
w = 6/3 #w is a float
print (w)
print (type(w))
x = 6.0/2 #x is a float
print (x)
print (type(x))
y = 3 + 0.0 #y is a float
print (y)
print (type(y))
z = 2 ** 3.0 #z is a float
print (z)
print (type(z))
z = str(z) #now it is a string
print (z)
print (type(z))
l = "1" #l is a string
print (l)
print (type(l))

#Concat by + and repeated by *
